# Extensions & Integrations Ecosystem

## New Integrations Added
I have expanded the integration ecosystem by adding three new major integrations, complete with dedicated landing pages and setup instructions.

### 1. **Slack Integration** (`/integrations/slack`)
- **Features**: Automatic message capture, thread tracking, reaction bookmarks, file indexing.
- **Setup**: Slack App installation, channel configuration, API connection.
- **Value**: Captures critical discussions and decisions from your workspace.

### 2. **Notion Integration** (`/integrations/notion`)
- **Features**: Bi-directional sync, page/database indexing, block-level capture.
- **Setup**: Integration creation, page sharing, sync configuration.
- **Value**: Syncs your knowledge base and keeps documentation up to date.

### 3. **Obsidian Integration** (`/integrations/obsidian`)
- **Features**: Vault sync, markdown indexing, backlink resolution, graph view integration.
- **Setup**: Community plugin installation, API configuration, initial sync.
- **Value**: Connects your second brain and syncs markdown notes.

## Updates to Existing Integrations
Refined existing integration pages to align with the "Rverity" branding and ensure consistency.

- **VS Code** (`/integrations/vscode`): Updated comments and setup steps to reference "Rverity" instead of "NeuroSync".
- **GitHub** (`/integrations/github`): Updated App Name in setup instructions to "Rverity".

## Component Updates

### 1. Landing Page (`IntegrationsGrid.tsx`)
Updated the landing page grid to include the new Slack, Notion, and Obsidian integrations, linking them to their respective marketing pages. Added appropriate icons (MessageSquare, FileText, BookOpen).

### 2. Dashboard Settings (`IntegrationsSection.tsx`)
Added the new integrations to the user dashboard settings.
- Users can now see Slack, Notion, and Obsidian in their integration list.
- Each item includes a "View Guide" link directing them to thesetup instructions.
- Added color-coded styling (Rose for Slack, Emerald for Notion, Violet for Obsidian).

## Ecosystem Status
The platform now showcases 6 core integrations:
1. **VS Code** (Dev context)
2. **Browser** (Web research)
3. **GitHub** (Code activity)
4. **Slack** (Communication)
5. **Notion** (Knowledge base)
6. **Obsidian** (Personal notes)

This provides a comprehensive "Second Brain" coverage across code, web, chat, and docs.
