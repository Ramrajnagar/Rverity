# Rverity

**The Operating System for your Digital Soul.**

> *"We are drowning in information but starved for knowledge."* — John Naisbitt

### The Problem
You live in a fragmented world. Your code is on GitHub, your research is in Chrome, your thoughts are in Obsidian or Notion. 
AI models are generic geniuses—they know everything about the world, but **nothing about you**.

### The Solution: Rverity
Rverity is a self-hosted **Knowledge Graph** that unifies your digital existence. It doesn't just "search" your history. 
It **observes**, **vectors**, and **links** your interactions across VS Code, Chrome, and your local environment into a single, navigable 3D graph.

It is the context layer for the post-AGI world.

## ⚡ Quick Start

Rverity is designed for sovereignty. You run it. You own it.

```bash
# Clone the protocol
git clone https://github.com/Ramrajnagar/Rverity.git
cd neurosync-ai

# Ignite the engine
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000`. Welcome to your second brain.

## 🛠️ Architecture

We built this stack for speed, privacy, and aesthetic perfection.

- **Core**: Next.js 16 (App Router), Node.js Edge Runtime.
- **Visuals**: React Three Fiber (WebGL), Framer Motion.
- **Memory**: Supabase (pgvector), Upstash Redis.
- **Intelligence**: OpenAI / Anthropic Embeddings.
